Royal Stay Hotel Management System
Royal Stay Hotel requires a software application to improve the guest experience and efficiently manage bookings and records. The critical requirements for the software application are as follows:

Room Management: The system should maintain a comprehensive catalogue of available rooms at the hotel. Each room should have detailed information such as room number, type (e.g., single, double, suite), amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, television, mini-bar), price per night, and availability status.

Guest Management: The system should facilitate the management of guest information, including personal details such as name, contact information, and loyalty status. Guests can create accounts, update their profiles, and view their reservation history.

Booking System: The system should allow guests to search for available rooms, make reservations online, and select check-in and check-out dates. Guests should receive immediate confirmation of their bookings via email or in-app notification.

Payment and Invoicing: Each booking should generate an invoice that details the nightly rate, any additional charges (e.g., room service, cleaning fees), and applicable discounts or promotions. Payment options should include credit/debit cards, mobile wallets, and other payment methods.

Loyalty Rewards Program: The system should support a loyalty program where returning guests can earn points for their stays, redeemable for discounts or free nights. Guests should be able to track their points and available rewards through their accounts.

Guest Services and Requests: Guests should be able to request additional services (e.g., housekeeping, room service, transportation) through the app. These requests should be sent to the relevant hotel staff for prompt action.

Feedback and Reviews: After their stay, guests should be able to provide feedback and rate their experience at the hotel. This information will help the hotel improve services and assist future guests in making informed decisions.
